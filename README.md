Project Description: Customer Cart Abandonment

This project is a study aimed at understanding and predicting customers' abandonment of online shopping carts in e-commerce. Abandonment is an e-commerce term used to identify a visitor who leaves a web page without completing the desired action. For example, we can refer to cart abandonment, which signifies the situation where customers add products to their online shopping carts but exit without completing the purchase transaction.

Business Understanding: Customer Cart Abandonment

If a customer visits a web page, we need to predict whether the customer will abandon it or not. By doing so, we can provide appropriate offers to these customers, thereby reducing the cart abandonment rate in terms of increasing profitability. There are several questions that we can answer through analysis:

What is the likelihood of a customer abandoning the shopping cart if they are viewing product details?
What are the important factors related to cart abandonment?
How can we determine if a customer will abandon the cart in the future

In this project, our goal is to build a model that predicts the likelihood of customers abandoning their carts based on customer behaviors and attributes. This model can provide valuable insights to e-commerce companies in terms of analyzing abandonment rates, improving customer experience, and increasing sales.
